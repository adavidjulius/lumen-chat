# Lumen Persistent Session State & Resumption System — Implementation & Verification Report

## Executive Summary

Lumen previously stored history and facts across runs (`task_memory`, `conversation_summaries`), but lacked a living **working state** document to reconstruct active intent upon reopening mid-task. This system resolves resumption specifically by introducing an actively maintained `task_working_state` SQLite table in `.lumen/memory.db`, updating state at natural step checkpoints and guaranteed exit paths, performing startup resumption checks, enforcing honest state descriptions, and exposing resumption indicators to the UI dashboard.

---

## 1. Stage 1: Working State Schema

Added SQLite table `task_working_state` in `.lumen/memory.db` managed by `WorkingStateManager` (`src/memory/working_state.py`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task_working_state (
    task_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    goal TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Original task restated clearly
    current_plan TEXT NOT NULL,            -- Evolving step-by-step plan
    completed_subtasks TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',   -- JSON list of completed subtasks
    remaining_subtasks TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',   -- JSON list of remaining subtasks
    last_known_good_state TEXT NOT NULL,   -- Specific description written by agent for future self
    blockers TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',   -- Stuck/unresolved items
    files_in_progress TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',    -- Files being actively modified
    last_updated REAL NOT NULL,
    session_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, -- Number of sessions touching task
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'in_progress'  -- 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'abandoned'
);
```

### Key Modules:
- [working_state.py](file:///Users/davidjulius/Desktop/Lumen/src/memory/working_state.py): `WorkingStateManager` and `TaskWorkingState` data model.
- [__init__.py](file:///Users/davidjulius/Desktop/Lumen/src/memory/__init__.py): Exported `WorkingStateManager` and `TaskWorkingState`.

---

## 2. Stage 2 & 4: Step Loop Integration & Honesty Guarantees

Modified `WebAgent` step loop ([web_agent.py](file:///Users/davidjulius/Desktop/Lumen/src/web_agent.py)):

### Checkpoint Updates:
- `_update_checkpoint()` updates working state after completing file edits (`write_file`, `edit_file`), bash command executions (`run_bash`), or plan revisions.
- Files edited are added to `files_in_progress`, finished steps to `completed_subtasks`.

### Exit Path Guarantee & In-Flight Tracking:
- Before executing any file write, `_current_in_flight_action` and `_current_in_flight_file` are logged.
- If process is interrupted or hard-killed mid-write, pre-write state is written as:
  `"uncertain — last action was writing X, outcome unconfirmed"`
- `_write_working_state_exit()` is invoked on all exit paths (`done`, `max_steps`, `error`, `abort`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`).
- When `action == 'done'`, `status` is set to `'completed'`.

---

## 3. Stage 3 & 4: Startup Resumption Check & Re-verification

At the start of `WebAgent.run()`:
1. Queries `get_active_tasks(project_id)` for non-terminal tasks (`status = 'in_progress'`).
2. Performs disk re-verification for any task with `"uncertain"` state or `files_in_progress` (checking file existence, non-zero size, and presence of `.bak` backup files).
3. Surfaces all active tasks to console and emits `resumption_prompt` event with:
   - Task goal & ID
   - Last known good state
   - Completed & remaining subtasks
   - Blockers & files in progress
   - Session count
   - Staleness flag (30-day rule)
4. If multiple tasks exist, lists all of them without silent selection or hidden assumptions.

---

## 4. Stage 5: UI & Dashboard Integration

Updated `lumen_dashboard_api/main.py` ([main.py](file:///Users/davidjulius/Desktop/Lumen/lumen_dashboard_api/main.py)):
- Exposed GET endpoint `/api/resumption/tasks?project_id=...`
- Returns active `task_working_state` entries, subtasks, `last_known_good_state`, and `likely_abandoned` boolean for dashboard screens.

---

## 5. Stage 6: Staleness & Cleanup Lifecycle

- Completed tasks set `status = 'completed'` (retained for history, not overwritten).
- `is_likely_abandoned()` returns `True` for tasks untouched for >= 30 days (`last_updated`), flagging them as `" ⚠️ [LIKELY ABANDONED - >30 days old]"`.

---

## 6. Verification & Test Output

Ran automated test suite in [test_session_resumption.py](file:///Users/davidjulius/Desktop/Lumen/tests/test_session_resumption.py):

### Verified Scenarios:
1. **SQLite CRUD**: Table creation, WAL mode, record upserts, fetching active tasks, marking completion.
2. **Hard-Kill `kill -9` Mid-Task**: Subprocess started multi-step task, hard-killed mid-task, state retrieved on restart with specific `last_known_good_state`.
3. **Uncertain File Write Re-Verification**: Simulated write crash, restarted, confirmed state reported as unconfirmed, disk verified, and updated accurately.
4. **Zero False Positives**: Completed tasks do not trigger resumption prompts.
5. **Staleness Rule**: 31-day-old task correctly flagged as likely abandoned.
6. **Dashboard API**: `/api/resumption/tasks` returned active task status correctly.
